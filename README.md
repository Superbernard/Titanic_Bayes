# Titanic_Bayes
A practice project that applies Bayesian statistics on Titanic data. It was done during the course Math5803 Bayesian Statistics. In the project, Bayesian and classic logistic regression models were established to explore the effects of different predictor variables on survival. Performance of both models were also compared, along with the artificial neural network prediction model.
